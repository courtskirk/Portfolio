                Our idea is to create a web application that functions as a random game generator. We currently intend to call it “If You’re Bored” . 
                The site will randomly generate a game for the user to play and they can continuously cycle through random games. 
                If they stumble upon a game they really like there will be the option to only play that game, as well as the option to view all games in a galleria format. 
                The site will consist of other features but that is the main idea. Other potential features include artistic simulations, profile picture creator, and the 
                ability to upload your own apps to the site. Our app will serve as a mixture between CoolMath.com and apps like ClubPenguin & Poptropica, but for people of higher 
                age groups. Any age group would be welcomed though, of course. 
	            The frontend development will essentially require a nice looking but efficient UX/UI design, to attract the users’ eye as well as allow easy navigation throughout the site.
                The backend and database development will consist of things like holding user data, as well as allowing for the functioning for the various javascript games.
